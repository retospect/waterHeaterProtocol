# AO Smith Voltex water heater protocol bus connector

The [A.O. Smith Voltex](https://www.hotwater.com/water-heaters/residential/electric/proline/xe/voltex-hybrid-electric-heat-pump/) series of heat pump water heaters are using a CTA-2045 interface.
The [CTA-2045 specifications](https://shop.cta.tech/products/modular-communications-interface-for-energy-management) are available for free and contain pinouts and protocol information. 
It's a [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485) bus. 
It uses an AC UCM connector, also carries AC (110V?220V?)? Please send me part numbers if you find out.
